# Firefox Credential Harvester

A Python script which allows users to quickly grab and decrypt the signon data stored in an installation of Mozilla Firefox.

This python script will allow you to acquire the signon data stored in signons sqlite database and then systematically decrypt all the passwords and usersnames in the signon.sqlite database. This script is for educational purposes only and I do not hold any responsibility for the use of this open source python script.
